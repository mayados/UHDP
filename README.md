# UHDP

UHDP is a virtual graveyard for pets. But it is also a space with a social aspect. Indeed, users can create a "Belle histoire" wich is a story about animals to cheer up people who have lost a pet. Also, users can like stories and memorials by adding a paw to it and leaving comments. Users can search memorials based on multi filters. 
This was my exam project for the Web Developer professional title
